###### Basic definitions

Vectors
: Tuple-types which are a displacement in time. A means to transform values.

Points
: Tuples-types which are a location, a point, in time. A means to declare values.

Tuples
: [x, y, z] are our three-axis co-ordinated members found within a tuple.-
-Whereas _w_ is a boolean member (where _1_ is-equal-to a Point in _delta time_,- -_0_ is-equal-to a Vector in _delta time_)-
-declaring whether it's a Point or Vector.

###### Basic factory functions

Create type-casting conversion factory functions: `point()` and `vector()`-
-for our in-house engine.
